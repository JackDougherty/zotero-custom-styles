Dougherty, Jack. "Defining Purpose and Process in Teaching History with Case Studies." *History of Education Quarterly* 56, no. 1 (February 1, 2016): 116--25. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hoeq.12152>. Abstract: This teaching forum has taught me that historians still need a richer vocabulary to describe exactly what we mean by "teaching with case studies," because that empty phrase reveals almost nothing about what we actually do in our classrooms or, more importantly, how our students learn. In this essay, my aim is to enrich our discussion by emphasizing both the purpose and process of teaching history with case studies, to help us articulate more clearly both the why and how behind what we do in our courses.
